# Free AI Setup Guide - Google Gemini

## 🆓 Free Alternative to OpenAI

Since your OpenAI API key has exceeded its quota, I've set up a **completely free** alternative using Google's Gemini API.

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Created Gemini Service** (`src/services/geminiService.js`)
   - Uses Google's free Gemini 1.5 Flash model
   - Same functionality as OpenAI but completely free
   - 15 requests per minute, 1 million tokens per day

2. **Created Unified AI Service** (`src/services/aiService.js`)
   - Automatically chooses Gemini (free) over OpenAI (paid)
   - Seamless switching between providers
   - Better error handling

3. **Updated All Components**
   - Professional Summary generation
   - Experience descriptions
   - Project descriptions
   - All now use the unified AI service

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Free Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key (starts with `AIza`)

### Step 2: Configure Your Environment

1. Open the `.env` file in your project root
2. Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
3. Save the file

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm start
```

## 🎉 That's It!

Your AI features will now work completely **FREE** with Google Gemini!

## 🛠️ How It Works

The system now automatically:

1. **Checks for Gemini API key first** (free option)
2. **Falls back to OpenAI** if Gemini isn't configured
3. **Shows clear error messages** if neither is set up
4. **Logs which provider is being used** in the console

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "AI service not configured" Error
1. Make sure you've added your Gemini API key to `.env`
2. Restart the development server
3. Check that the API key starts with `AIza`

### API Request Errors
1. Verify your Google account has API access
2. Check if you've exceeded the free tier limits
3. Ensure your API key is valid and active

### Still Want to Use OpenAI?
1. Add credits to your OpenAI account
2. Uncomment the OpenAI API key line in `.env`
3. The system will automatically use OpenAI if Gemini fails

## 📈 Free Tier Limits

Google Gemini offers generous free limits:
- **15 requests per minute**
- **1 million tokens per day**
- **No credit card required**

This is more than enough for personal resume building!

## 🔄 Switching Between Providers

The system automatically prioritizes:
1. **Gemini** (if configured) - Free
2. **OpenAI** (if configured) - Paid
3. **Error message** (if neither configured)

You can have both API keys configured, and the system will use Gemini first to save costs.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Get your free Gemini API key
2. Add it to your `.env` file
3. Restart the server
4. Test the AI features - they should work perfectly!

The AI generation will now work without any quota or billing issues. Enjoy your free AI-powered resume builder! 🚀
